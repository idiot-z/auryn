2015-07-01 Friedemann Zenke <fzenke@stanford.edu>
 * Added PairInteractionConnection to implement arbitrary (pairwise)
 STDP windows
 * Added backend to implement current based synapses with temporal dynamics
 * Added code to stimulate with currents generated from a Wiener process
 (NormalStimulator)
 * Added the AdEx neuron model
 * Added the SIFGroup neuron model
 * Implemented load/save to netstate files of Checkers
 * Changed backend of WeightMonitor to avoid segfaults after loading the
 network state
 * Implementation of moving average for progress bar moved 
 to System class to disambiguate from Checkers
 * Fixed some problems in ComplexMatrix
 * Bug fixes

 * SpikingGroups and Connections are now serializeable and as a consequence
 the network state can be saved to a single file per rank.
 * SimpleMatrix has been replaced by ComplexMatrix which creates the
 basis for the implementation of connection models with multiple
 internal synaptic states.
 * Basis for Monitors writing to binary files for increased performance was
 created (e.g. BinarySpikeMonitor).
 * Auryn compiles to a statically linkable library per default now, which
 facilitates to decouple simulation code from simulator code.  * A simplified
 STDPConnection was added along with a tutorial of how to implement own new
 plasticity and synapse models.
 * Adds integrate-and-fire model for exclusive use with current based synapses
 (CubaIFGroup).
 * Adds an example simulation for short-term-plasticity (STPConnection).
 * Improves doxygen strings and comments in various places.
 * Diverse bugfixes.

2014-02-21 Friedemann Zenke <friedemann.zenke@epfl.ch> 
 * Adds new example code for Brunel 2000 balanced network
 * Applies diverse bugfixes

2014-01-20 Friedemann Zenke <friedemann.zenke@epfl.ch> 
 
 * Added release information version v0.3.
 * Changed custom written MPI code to MPI_Allgather
 with adaptive receive buffer size.
 * Fixes a bug in SyncBuffer that was effecting
 short term plasticity.
 * Several bugfixes.
